# Sama CLI

The Sama CLI helps you to create tasks in the Sama Platform right from the terminal.

With the Sama CLI, you can:

- Create tasks in your Sama Project.
- Easily upload image, video, or 3d assets to Sama's S3 bucket.
- Generate a CVS or JSON of tasks to be created.
- Monitor task creation.

## Installation

Sama CLI is available for macOS, and Windows.

### macOS

Sama CLI is available on macOS via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew tap Samasource/formulas
brew install sama
```

### Windows

Sama CLI is available on Windows as a downloadable MSI.

## Usage

Installing the CLI provides access to the `sama` command from the terminal.

Run the `sama` command to test if the CLI has been successfully installed:

```sh-session
$ sama
Sama CLI for interacting with the sama API

Usage:
  sama [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  init        initialises sama project, prompting the user for project settings.
  task        Root of task command tree

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for sama

Use "sama [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Configuration

Before using the Sama CLI, you need to specify the Sama Project ID, API Key, and AWS credentials to Sama's S3 Bucket to use, all which are provided by your Sama project manager. The following instructions also assume that your Sama Project manager has already configured all the neccessary Sama Project inputs and outputs.

Create a new folder and set the current working directory to it. For example,
```sh
$ mkdir my_sama_project
$ cd my_sama_project
```

Run the `sama init` command:
```sh
$ sama init
? Project ID: YOUR_SAMA_PROJECT_ID
? API Key: YOUR_SAMA_API_KEY
? Sama AWS Access Key ID: YOUR_SAMA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? Sama AWS Secret Access Key: YOUR_SAMA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
The above data will be saved into **.sama.yaml** in your current working directory.
Note: to use the AWS credentials stored in ~/.aws/credentials or %USERPROFILE%\\.aws\\credentials, leave “Sama AWS Access Key ID” and “Sama AWS Secret Access Key” blank.

You'll then be prompted to create the mapping json which contains your Sama Project inputs and maps it to values generated by the CLI. The CLI will _attempt to auto-generate_ the mapping json by looking at the required inputs set up in your Sama Project. See [Configuring the mapping json](#Configuring-the-mapping-json) below for more info.
```sh
? No mapping json found in project. Would you like to auto-generate it? Yes
{
  "name": "{{ .BaseName }}",
  "url": "{{ .URL }}",
  "client batch id": "{{ .ClientBatchID }}",
  "group id": "{{ .GroupID }}",
  "file size": "{{ .FileSizeBytes }}"
}
```
The above example has a Sama Project already set up with inputs "name"(string), "url"(URL), "client batch id"(string), "group id"(string), and "file size"(string). The mapping json will be saved into **.mapping.json.gotmpl** in your current working directory.

### Configuring the mapping json

The mapping json, **mapping.json.gotmpl**, contains your Sama Project inputs and values that will be sent during task creation. The values that you see in **{{ }}** are special variables used by the CLI and are replaced during task creation. The list of special variables are:
- "{{ .BaseName }}" - gets replaced by the asset's name, e.g. image001.png
- "{{ .URL }}" - gets replaced by the asset's URL path in Sama's S3, e.g. https&#65279;://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_batch001/image001.png
- "{{ .ClientBatchID }}" - gets replaced by the string specified with the --client-batch-id flag
- "{{ .GroupID }}" - gets replaced by a unique groupID when using the --group-size flag
- "{{ .FileSizeBytes }}" - gets replaced by the asset's file size

When you call `sama init`, the CLI will do it's best to automatically use the special variables depending on your Sama Project's inputs.
- If you have an input called "name", "asset name", or "file name", the CLI will automatically insert "{{ .BaseName }}" as it's value.
- If you have an input type of "URL", the CLI will automatically insert "{{ .URL }}" as it's value.
- If you have an input type that is marked as "Client Batch ID", the CLI will automatically insert "{{ .ClientBatchID }}" as it's value.
- If you have an input type that is marked as "Task Group ID", the CLI will automatically insert "{{ .GroupID }}" as it's value.
- If you have an input called "size", "asset size", or "file size", the CLI will automatically insert "{{ .FileSizeBytes}}" as it's value.

If needed, modify **mapping.json.gotmpl** so that the proper data is sent during task creation. [Examples](#Examples) of the mapping json are given below.

## Commands

### `task create`
```sh
Create tasks from local file system or S3

Usage:
  sama task create <localPath or S3Path> [flags]
Flags:
      --client-batch-id string   client batch id value for mapping substitution
      --group-size int           will group tasks with this group size
  -h, --help                     help for create
      --in-batches               send each folder as its own batch
      --in-client-batches        send each folder as its own batch substituting the folder name as ClientBatchID
      --modified-after string    creates tasks from assets that were modified after given datetime string
      --modified-before string   creates tasks from assets that were modified before given datetime string
      --monitor                  if present will monitor the batch of tasks immediately after creation
      --output string            if present will output the task data to output file instead of sending task creation request
      --from-file                when true treats the path as local file path to a csv or json batch upload file
```

### `task monitor`

```sh
monitors the batch status in real time

Usage:
  sama task monitor <batch id> [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for monitor
```

## Examples

### Creating tasks given a local path. Project has single URL input.
```
The mapping file can be automatically be generated during init. e.g.
    { 
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}",
        "url": "{{.URL}}"
    }

The following 'task create' command creates a task for each video file. Assume the following asset folder exists locally:
    ./assets/
        assets_batch001/ 
            video001.mp4
            video002.mp4
            video003.mp4

$ sama task create ./assets/assets_batch001
        
Output:
    A task will be created for video001.mp4:
        "name" : video001.mp4
        "url" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_001/video001.mp4"
    A task will be created for video002.mp4:
        "name" : video002.mp4
        "url" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_001/video002.mp4"
    A task will be created for video003.mp4:
        "name" : video003.mp4
        "url" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_001/video003.mp4"
```

### Creating tasks given a S3Path. Project has single URL input.

```
The mapping file can be automatically be generated during init. e.g.
    { 
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}",
        "url": "{{.URL}}"
    }

The following 'task create' command creates a task for each video file. Assume the following asset folder already exists in S3:
    s3://sama-client-assets/123/assets/assets_batch002/
        video001.mp4
        video002.mp4
        video003.mp4

$ sama task create assets/assets_batch002
        
Output:
    A task will be created for video001.mp4:
        "name" : video001.mp4
        "url" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets/assets_batch002/video001.mp4"
    A task will be created for video002.mp4:
        "name" : video002.mp4
        "url" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets/assets_batch002/video002.mp4"
    A task will be created for video003.mp4:
        "name" : video003.mp4
        "url" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets/assets_batch002/video003.mp4"
```

### Monitoring a batch immediately from task create command

```
Add the --monitor flag to 'task create':

$ sama task create assets_batch002 --monitor

```

### Monitor batch

```
Assume that batch 11236 exists. Call 'task monitor':

$ sama task monitor 11236

Output:
 Batch 11236: 
  uploaded...

```


### Creating tasks given a local path. Project has multiple URL inputs, for example, a 3D project with 2D helper videos

```
The mapping file will be automatically be generated during init as, for example:
    {
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}", 
        "3d_url_input": "{{.URL}}",
        "3d_sensor_location" : "{{.URL}}",
        "2d_back_url_input": "{{.URL}}",
        "2d_front_url_input": "{{.URL}}"
    }

However, since there are multiple URL inputs, the folder containing the correct assets need to be specified, for example: 
    {
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}", 
        "3d_url_input": "{{.URL}}lidar/",
        "3d_sensor_location" : "{{.URL}}sensor_location/",
        "2d_back_url_input": "{{.URL}}back_video/",
        "2d_front_url_input": "{{.URL}}front_video/"
    }

The following 'task create' command creates a task for each 3d folder. Assume the following asset folder exists locally:
    ./assets/
        assets_batch001/
            sequence1/
                 lidar/    
                    001.pcd
                    002.pcd
                 back_video/
                    001.jpg
                    002.jpg
                 front_video/
                    001.jpg
                    002.jpg
                 sensor_location/
                    001.csv
                    002.csv
            sequence2/
                 lidar/    
                    001.pcd
                    002.pcd
                 back_video/
                    001.jpg
                    002.jpg
                 front_video/
                    001.jpg
                    002.jpg
                 sensor_location/
                    001.csv
                    002.csv

$ sama task create ./assets/assets_batch001

Output:
    A task will be created for sequence1/:
        "name" : sequence1
        "3d_url_input" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets/assets_batch001/sequence1/lidar/"
        "3d_sensor_location" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets/assets_batch001/sequence1/sensor_location/"
        "2d_back_url_input" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets/assets_batch001/sequence1/back_video/"
        "2d_front_url_input" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets/assets_batch001/sequence1/front_video/"
   
    A task will be created for sequence2/:
        "name" : sequence2
        "3d_url_input" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_batch001/sequence2/lidar/"
        "3d_sensor_location" :"https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_batch001/sequence2/sensor_location/"
        "2d_back_url_input" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_batch001/sequence2/back_video/"
        "2d_front_url_input" : "https://sama-client-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/123/assets_batch001/sequence2/front_video/"
```


### Creating tasks where files are contained in separate folder and is considered it's own batch. 

```
The mapping file can be automatically be generated during init. e.g.
    { 
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}",
        "url": "{{.URL}}"
    }

The following 'task create' command creates task for each file. Assume the following assets exists locally:
    assets/
        assets_batch001/
            img001.png
            img002.png
            img003.png
        assets_batch002/
            img004.png
            img005.png
            img006.png

$ sama task create ./assets --in-batches

Output:
    A batch will create individual tasks for img001.png, img002.png, img003.png.
    A batch will create individual tasks for img004.png, img005.png, img006.png.
```

### Creating tasks where files are contained in separate folder and is considered it's own batch, plus assigning the folder as the client-batch-id 
```
The mapping file can be automatically be generated during init. e.g.
    { 
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}",
        "url": "{{.URL}}",
        "client batch id": "{{ .ClientBatchID }}"
    }

The following 'task create' command creates task for each file. Assume the following assets exists locally:
    assets/
        assets_batch001/
            img001.png
            img002.png
            img003.png
        assets_batch002/
            img004.png
            img005.png
            img006.png

$ sama task create ./assets --in-client-batches

Output:
    A batch will create individual tasks for img001.png, img002.png, img003.png and 'client batch id' is set to assets_batch001.
    A batch will create individual tasks for img004.png, img005.png, img006.png and 'client batch id' is set to assets_batch002.
```

### Creating tasks and specified a client-batch-id

```
The mapping file can be automatically be generated during init. e.g.
    { 
        "url": "{{.URL}}",
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}",
        "client batch id": "{{ .ClientBatchID }}"
     }

The following 'task create' command creates task for each file. Assume the following assets exists locally:
    ./assets/
        assets_batch001/
            img001.png
            img002.png
            img003.png


$ sama task create ./assets/assets_batch001 --client-batch-id "my_batch_001"

Output:
    A batch will create individual tasks for img001.png, img002.png, img003.png and 'client batch id' is set to 'my_batch_001'.
```

### Create tasks and group them according to size

```
The mapping file can be automatically be generated during init. e.g.
    { 
        "example_input_url": "{{.URL}}",
        "name": "{{ .BaseName }}",
        "example_input_batch_id": "{{ .GroupID }}"
     }

The following 'task create' command creates task for each file. Assume the following assets exists locally:
    ./assets/
        assets_batch001/
            img001.png
            img002.png
            img003.png
            img004.png
            img005.png

$ sama task create ./assets/assets_batch001 --group-size 2

Output:
    Invididual tasks are created for img001.png, img002.png and are assigned to the same group id (auto assigned).
    Invididual tasks are created for img003.png, img004.png and are assigned to the same group id (auto assigned).
    Invididual tasks are created for img005.png and are assigned to the same group id (auto assigned).
```

### Export tasks to CSV or JSON
```
$ sama task create ./assets_batch001 --output tasks.csv
$ sama task create ./assets_batch001 --output tasks.json
```

### Create tasks from a CSV or JSON
```
$ sama task create --from-file ./tasks.csv
$ sama task create --from-file ./tasks.json
```

### Create tasks from assets that were modified within a date range
```
